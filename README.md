# Skylark Practice and Designs by JennHuygen and @teun95
This is supposed to become a repository of practice models in SketchUp based on the WikiHouse Skylark system. I found it quite difficult to get started with designing my first Skylark model in SketchUp and hope that sharing my work will make it easier for others.

The first model has a detailed write-up of the creating process. I intend to do the same for at least a number of practice projects in the next few weeks.

Feel free to comment, open issues, or fork. Looking forward to learning from you.

Licence information below. Do whatever you like with my models, as long as the WikiHouse license permits it.

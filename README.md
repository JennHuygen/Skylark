# Skylark Practice and Designs by JennHuygen and @teun95
This is supposed to become a repository of practice models in SketchUp based on the WikiHouse Skylark system. I found it quite difficult to get started with designing my first Skylark model in SketchUp and hope that sharing my work will make it easier for others.

The <a href="https://github.com/JennHuygen/Skylark/tree/main/Sketchup%20Models/Building%20Centre%20London%20Model">first model</a> is a recreation of the WikiHouse Skylark Model as displayed at the Building Design Centre in London as part of the Skylark system launch in February 2022. It has a detailed write-up of the creating process to help others recreate the model and practice with Skylark. I intend to do the same for at least a number of practice projects in the next few weeks so feel free to watch this repository and receive updates if you are interested.

I've also created an updated version of the WikiHouse Simple Starter Kit, file titled "Starter_Simple_Design_Kit_Skylark250". Using this file will hopefully make it easier to start designing in SketchUp immediately. The file includes all current Skylark 250 Simple Design Kit blocks as created by the WikiHouse team and available <a href="https://www.wikihouse.cc/blocks">here</a>. In addition, I've created six new components that are assembled out of Skylark combs and the relevant end floor blocks fitted to them:
1. SMALL_A_X
2. SMALL_B_X
3. MEDIUM_A_X
4. MEDIUM_B_X
5. LARGE_A_X
6. LARGE_B_X

These components correspond with the standard floor block sizes of WikiHouse. The components have the necessary ground (A) or mid-level (B) combs with the end floor block combined already for the X-axis. This means you can start building right away, and the only additional combs you will need to add in your design are for the Y-axis and the gabled roof (if using).

Feel free to comment, open issues, or fork on all my files and designs. Looking forward to learning from you.

Licence information below. Do whatever you like with my models, as long as the WikiHouse license permits it. I would also encourage you to upload your designs and progress so we can learn from eachother.

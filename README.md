# Skylark Practice and Designs by JennHuygen and @teun95
This is supposed to become a repository of practice models in SketchUp based on the WikiHouse Skylark system. I found it quite difficult to get started with designing my first Skylark model in SketchUp and hope that sharing my work will make it easier for others. In time, I will also add our designs and thinking of our own WikiHouse.

## Practice

The <a href="https://github.com/JennHuygen/Skylark/tree/main/Sketchup%20Models/Building%20Centre%20London%20Model">first model</a> is a recreation of the WikiHouse Skylark Model as displayed at the Building Design Centre in London as part of the Skylark system launch in February 2022. It has a detailed write-up of the creating process to help others recreate the model and practice with Skylark. I intend to do the same for at least a number of practice projects in the next few weeks so feel free to watch this repository and receive updates if you are interested.

In addition, I have created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxqJFwyInPRhU7dW6hlH2b6reHegjWC60">a playlist on YouTube</a>  where I show how to model with WikiHouse Skylark. As with the repository here on GitHub, I will add more of our thinking and designs in YouTube videos in time.

## Starter resources

I've also created an updated version of the WikiHouse Simple Starter Kit, file titled "Starter_Simple_Design_Kit_Skylark250". Using this file will hopefully make it easier to start designing in SketchUp immediately. The file includes all current Skylark 250 Simple Design Kit blocks as created by the WikiHouse team and available <a href="https://www.wikihouse.cc/blocks">here</a>. In addition, I've created new components that are assembled out of Skylark combs and the relevant end floor blocks fitted to them.

These components correspond with the standard floor block sizes of WikiHouse. The components have the necessary ground (A) or mid-level (B) combs with the end floor block combined already for the X-axis. This means you can start building right away, and the only additional combs you will need to add in your design are for the Y-axis.

I have also created a new roof_G block which is a combination of the G COMBS and end roof block to create the ends of the gabled roof form. The roof_G is used as the X-axis on both ends of your house to create a gabled roof. For more information about roofs, have a look at my roofs practice <a href="https://github.com/JennHuygen/Skylark/tree/main/Sketchup%20Practice/Roofs">here</a>. 

Finally, I created a new component for the walls that support the gable roof. This component has the full gable roof walls combined already so you can just move them onto the x-axis in your design and don't need to add each individual wall block anymore.

Feel free to comment, open issues, or fork on all my files and designs. Looking forward to learning from you.

Licence information below. Do whatever you like with my models, as long as the WikiHouse license permits it. I would also encourage you to upload your designs and progress so we can learn from eachother.

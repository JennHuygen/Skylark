This SketchUp file includes the builds as shown in my YouTube tutorials.

## Blocks and Combs

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnHYP1pbvOs">first model</a> is a simple practice to explain the different blocks in the WikiHouse Skylark library, and how to model with the different combs. The linked video explains how to create the foundation of a medium-sized house. 

## Simple House

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK3MunYAU0Y">second model</a> is a simple practice to explain how to build a simple, one-storey house with the blocks in the WikiHouse Skylark library. This model has a flat roof using the regular floor beams. The linked video explains how to create the medium-sized house. 

## Gable Roof

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMkEJD-fQGo">third model</a> is a simple practice to explain how to build a two-storey house with a gable roof using the blocks in the WikiHouse Skylark library. This model builds on the simple house as created in the second video. It is a medium-sized house which has no stairs connecting the floors yet (stair blocks are not available yet in the Skylark library).
